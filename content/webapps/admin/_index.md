Along with the Camunda web applications we ship Admin, accessible via [http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/admin/](http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/admin/).
Admin is an application that allows you to configure users and groups via the engine's [Identity Service](../../user-guide/process-engine/identity-service.md) and authorizations via the engine's [Authorization Service](../../user-guide/process-engine/authorization-service.md). Furthermore, you can connect Camunda Admin to your [LDAP system](../../user-guide/process-engine/identity-service.md#the-ldap-identity-service).
